    "In the last lecture, I asked you to use git from the command line.  Macs come with a command line app (terminal.app) and since Macs are loosely similar to [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) the terminal commands are pretty much the same as those in [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) distributions.  Windows is a bit different, and because of this, I had you install git BASH if you are using a Windows machine.  What this means is that, even if you are using a Windows OS, you can still use the nice Unix commands as long as you are in the git BASH terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that there are various options for using ``git`` from the Desktop (e.g. see [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)).  However, it is more useful for you to be able to do things from the command line.  The reasons for this are that the command line is not going anywhere any time soon and that I can't predict what GUI you're future company/group will want you to use.  You'll be much more versatile using the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means, is that I have to teach you a little bit about how to navigate with the command line.  There are a few essential commands that you absolutely **must** know.  You'll pick up the rest as you go through you life.  Here are the essential ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ls**: list the contents of the current directory\n",
    "* **cd**: change to a new directory\n",
    "* **mv**: rename a directory or file OR move a directory or file to a new location\n",
    "* **cp**: copy a directory or file\n",
    "* **pwd**: print the working directory\n",
    "* **mkdir**: create a new directory\n",
    "* **rm**: remove a file (you can remove a directory with rm -r)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to work with these a bit.  In the following steps, you should hit the ``return`` key after typing each command.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up a terminal and type ``pwd``.  The output should be your home directory.\n",
    "2. Next type ``ls``.  You should see all the files and directories in your home directory.  Notice that if you type ``ls -l`` you get a list with more information where the files and directories are ordered alphabetically.  Typing ``ls -lt`` sorts the list by date/time created with the most recent file/directory at the top.  ``ls -ltr`` just reverses the order of the sort; now the most recent file/directory is at the bottom.\n",
    "3. Now type ``mkdir mydir``.  Voila!  You have just created a new directory.  Try ``ls`` again.  Do you see the new directory?\n",
    "4. To enter that directory type ``cd mydir``.  You just changed into your new directory.  Type ``pwd`` to see where you are.\n",
    "5. Now that you're inside your new directory, let's create a file in there.\n",
    "  * Type ``echo 'Hello world!' > newfile.txt``\n",
    "  * Type ``ls``.  You should see the next text file!\n",
    "  * To see the contents of the file, type ``cat newfile.txt``.\n",
    "6. Suppose you now want to rename ``newfile.txt`` to ``README.txt``.  Just execute ``mv newfile.txt README.txt``.  Type ``ls`` again if you wish.\n",
    "7. Maybe you really wanted to keep a copy of ``newfile.txt``.  Just do ``cp README.txt newfile.txt``.  As usual, ``ls`` will show you what you want to see.\n",
    "8. What if ``newfile.txt`` should actually be in a different directory?  Let's do the following:\n",
    "  * ``mkdir newdir``\n",
    "  * ``mv newfile.txt newdir\\``\n",
    "  * Altneratively, you could give the entire path of the new directory (not necessary here).  Here's how you would do that:\n",
    "    - ``pwd`` (just to see the current path)\n",
    "    - ``mv newfile.txt path_from_pwd/newdir/``\n",
    "9.  That was fun, but this directory is completely useless to use now.  Let's delete it.\n",
    "  * First, you need to get out of the current directory.  You can't delete a directory from within it!\n",
    "  * To go up one directory, just type ``cd ..``.\n",
    "     - **Unix Note:** In Unix, ``.`` stands for the current directory and ``..`` stands for the parent directory (that is, the directory containing the current directory.  Hence, ``cd ../`` changes to the parent directory of the current directory.\n",
    "     - **Unix Note:** If you want to go up two directories, just do ``cd ../../``.  You can use the same pattern for ``n`` directories.\n",
    "  * Now type ``rm mydir``.  You should see the message ``rm: mydir/: is a directory``.  ``rm`` cannot be used to removed directories as-is.  It can only remove files.\n",
    "  * To remove the directory type ``rm -rv mydir``.  The ``-r`` option says to recursively remove the directory and any contents.  The ``-v`` option says to be verbose while removing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a whirlwind tour through a few of the more useful Unix commands.  It won't take you long to use them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you want more information about any command, just type ``man command_name`` into the terminal.  This will bring up the manual page for that command.  You will see all sorts of information.  To scroll down, just hit the ``space bar``.  To exit the ``man page`` just type ``q`` (for quit).  Here's an example of a portion of the ``man page`` for the ``rm`` command:\n",
    "![rm man page](figs/rm_man_page.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus Command\n",
    "Suppose you want to copy a file from a different location to your current directory.  Well, recall that the current directory is represented by the `.` object.  Here are a few things you can do:\n",
    "* ``cp path_to_file/file .``: Will copy file to your current location\n",
    "* ``cp path_to_file/file ./sub_dir``:  Will copy file to the directory ``sub_dir`` in your current location\n",
    "* ``cp ../file .``:  Will copy file from the parent directory to your current location\n",
    "There are other, similar patterns to accomplish roughly the same thing.  You'll figure them out as you go through life."
