    "In the last lecture, I asked you to use git from the command line.  Macs come with a command line app (terminal.app) and since Macs are loosely similar to [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) the terminal commands are pretty much the same as those in [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) distributions.  Windows is a bit different, and because of this, I had you install git BASH if you are using a Windows machine.  What this means is that, even if you are using a Windows OS, you can still use the nice Unix commands as long as you are in the git BASH terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that there are various options for using ``git`` from the Desktop (e.g. see [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)).  However, it is more useful for you to be able to do things from the command line.  The reasons for this are that the command line is not going anywhere any time soon and that I can't predict what GUI you're future company/group will want you to use.  You'll be much more versatile using the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means, is that I have to teach you a little bit about how to navigate with the command line.  There are a few essential commands that you absolutely **must** know.  You'll pick up the rest as you go through you life.  Here are the essential ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ls**: list the contents of the current directory\n",
    "* **cd**: change to a new directory\n",
    "* **mv**: rename a directory or file\n",
    "* **cp**: copy a directory or file\n",
    "* **pwd**: print the working directory\n",
    "* **mkdir**: create a new directory\n",
    "* **rm**: remove a file (you can remove a directory with rm -r)\n",
    "* **rmdir**:  remove a directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to work with these a bit.  In the following steps, you should hit the ``return`` key after typing each command.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up a terminal and type ``pwd``.  The output should be your home directory.\n",
    "2. Next type ``ls``.  You should see all the files and directories in your home directory.  Notice that if you type ``ls -l`` you get a list with more information where the files and directories are ordered alphabetically.  Typing ``ls -lt`` sorts the list by date/time created with the most recent file/directory at the top.  ``ls -ltr`` just reverses the order of the sort; now the most recent file/directory is at the bottom.\n",
    "3. Now type ``mkdir mydir``.  Voila!  You have just created a new directory.  Try ``ls`` again.  Do you see the new directory?\n",
    "4. To enter that directory type ``cd mydir``.  You just changed into your new directory.  Type ``pwd`` to see where you are.\n",
