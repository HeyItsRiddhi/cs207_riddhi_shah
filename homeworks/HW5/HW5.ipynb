    "We will be using it for our projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic workflow goes something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You work on your part of the code in your own branch or fork\n",
    "2. On every commit you make and push to GitHub, your code is automatically tested on a fresh machine on Travis CI. This ensures that there are no specific dependencies on the structure of your machine that your code needs to run and also ensures that your changes are sane\n",
    "3. Now you submit a pull request to `master` in the main repo (the one you're hoping to contribute to). The repo manager creates a branch off `master`. \n",
    "4. This branch is also set to run tests on Travis. If all tests pass, then the pull request is accepted and your code becomes part of master.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use GitHub to integrate our roots library with Travis CI and Coveralls. Note that this is not the only workflow people use. Google git..github..workflow and feel free to choose another one for your group. Document your workflow on your project's README."
